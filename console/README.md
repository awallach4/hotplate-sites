# hotplate-console

This project is in early development. The idea is to build a CMS that stores data in Firestore. This app would be hosted along side the actual website hosted by Firebase. This project is for people who want to use Firebase to host normal dynamic websites (freelance web devs should enjoy this tool because they can use it to build cheap websites for clients!). This project is also for people who don't feel like paying the people at Flamelink (sorry Flamelink, but there's always room for competition!).

Again, since this is an early project, you are left with only these instructions:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
